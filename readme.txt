== Description ==
The AdPlugg WordPress Ad Plugin is a simple plugin that allows you to display
ads on your WordPress site.

The AdPlugg WordPress Ad Plugin works in conjunction with the 
[adplugg.com](http://www.adplugg.com) ad service.

Major features in version 1.1.8 include:

* Ability to add your AdPlugg ads to your WordPress site from the WordPress Administrator with no access to the underlying source code required.
* Ability to add you AdPlugg ads to any Widget Area on your site by dragging the AdPlugg Widget into that area.
* Support for Zones allowing you to put different ads in different locations on a page.
* Ad rotator feature allowing you to rotate which ads are displayed as well as the relative positioning of multiple ads.

PS: You'll need an [adplugg.com Access Code](https://www.adplugg.com/apusers/signup) to use it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the AdPlugg WordPress Ad Plugin to your blog.
2. Activate it.
3. Enter your [adplugg.com Acccess Code](https://www.adplugg.com/apusers/signup).
4. Drag the AdPlugg Ad Widget to the Widget Area where you want your ads to display.
5. Optionally add the Zone machine name into the widget. This will make it so that the AdPlugg server only loads ads designated for the zone into the widget.
